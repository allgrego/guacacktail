## About Guacacktail
Guacacktail is a web application where you can find a list of cocktails according to the main liquor you select.
Once you select the cocktail you want you are able to get its ingredients and how it is prepared.

You can watch the deployment in http://guacacktail.herokuapp.com/

Guacacktail is based on [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/), and powered by [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [The Cocktail DB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).
